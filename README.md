# TogglStreaks

An application for generating habit streak calendars automatically using the
Toggl API. This is for people who like the idea of the X effect and also use
Toggl to track time, but are too lazy to make cards manually. (I realize this
is probably just me).

## What is the X effect?

See
[/r/theXeffect](https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/comments/2839zy/thank_you_rthexeffect/)
on Reddit for an explanation. In short words -- make a card with 49 boxes
representing the days in 7 weeks. For every day you complete the target action,
make an X. After 49 boxes -- a habit is formed.

## Why?

Mostly to learn more Go (golang), working with APIs, JSON and timezones.
